# GeoARgraphy
An augmented reality geography guessing game made in Unity.

*This was made at **IIIT Allahabad** for **Hack in the North v4.0** by team **Array[] yaar;***



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Download or clone the repository onto your local machine.

Download the latest version of [Unity](http://www.unity.com/) from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

Download the image needed for the AR Earth model to show up from [here](https://github.com/rajatdiptabiswas/GeoARgraphy/blob/extra-docs/map.jpeg).

### Installing

Install Unity. Make sure to choose and install the Vuforia Augmented Reality library plugin during or after the installation.

Open the project in Unity on your system.

Things should load up smoothly. Any small warnings may be ignored.

If Android and iOS support is required, Android Development and iOS Development plugins should be installed as well.



## Deployment

Might need to install Android Studio with the Android SDK and JDK for exporting to an Android device.

For exporting an app to iOS, Xcode must be installed on a Mac running macOS 10.14 Mojave or later.

For a quick demo, an apk file has been attached to to the `extra-docs` branch at `Extras/GeoARgraphy.apk` which can be installed on an Android device. The apk compatibility cannot be guaranteed.

To use the app, open [`map.jpeg`](https://github.com/rajatdiptabiswas/GeoARgraphy/blob/extra-docs/map.jpeg) on a screen other than the one that has the app installed. Point the app's camera interface onto [`map.jpeg`](https://github.com/rajatdiptabiswas/GeoARgraphy/blob/extra-docs/map.jpeg) and an augmented reality model should pop up. Make sure the image on the other screen is easily visible by the app and no reflection or smudges hinder the visibility of the image.
